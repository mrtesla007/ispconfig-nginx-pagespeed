mysqltuner.pl
made it so Perl didn't spit out an error if a value was undefined.  Now the error is handled gracefully by the program.

changed tuner-default.cnf to not have table_cache (it has table_open_cache)
changed Uptime to Uptime_since_flush_status for most rates in tuner-default.cnf

added:
slow query rate
reads per sec
writes per sec
rate of sorts that cause temporary tables
rate of open files
rate of aborted connections
rate of aborted clients

  query_cache_size
Changed the label for query_cache_size from "Query cache" to "Query cache size"

Added the following variable printouts:
 sort_buffer_size printout
 read_rnd_buffer_size printout
 tmp_table_size
 max_heap_table_size
 slow_launch_time
 Max_used_connections
 max_connections
Added the following checks:
 rate of sorted rows 
 rate of reading first index entry

 rate of reading next table row
 rate of joins without indexes (removed Joins w/out indexes, Joins w/out indexes per day)
 MyISAM key buffer size
 max % MyISAM key buffer ever used
 rate of table open
 Table lock wait rate
 Total threads created
 Threads that are slow to launch
